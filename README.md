# Support Ticket Suggester

## PoC Theme : 
Enhancing Ciklum Service Desk with AI

## Short Description (A brief overview so that anyone who hasnâ€™t seen the demo yet can understand what you did.)
The existing Ciklum Service Desk search functionality only provides keyword match search to Jira and Confluence links, requiring users to manually select the appropriate category and sub-category 
for ticket submission. To improve this, we introduced an advanced solution by feeding ticket descriptions 
into a vector database (vectorDB) to generate the best matching semantic results. This process is further refined by a 
large language model (LLM) to deliver highly relevant responses to user queries, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Value Proposition:
Improved Search Accuracy, Enhanced User Experience, Increased Efficiency, Reduced Support Costs

## The Problem You Are Solving
Inefficient Search Results, Manual Categorization, User Experience, Resource Drain

## Challenges:
Data quality is not enough for providing best matching result while querying VectorDB.

## Solutions
Using Data Augmentation, the Description is enhanced using NPLAG library

## Results and Conclusion
The integration of AI-powered features into the Ciklum Service Desk has demonstrated substantial improvements in search accuracy, user experience, and operational efficiency. This successful implementation positions the Ciklum Service Desk as a leading-edge solution in the market, providing significant value to users and ensuring long-term sustainability and growth. Moving forward, continuous refinement and user feedback will be essential to maintain and enhance these benefits.
